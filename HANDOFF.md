# Handover: Base² and Slot² on the Powkiddy RGB20SX

Last updated 2026-11-06. Read this first. Older detail is in
[history/handoff-2026-11-05.md](history/handoff-2026-11-05.md).

## The two halves

- **Base²** (`basesq`): the OS, in [`os/`](os/README.md). Buildroot, our own kernel, and
  just enough to run a frontend.
- **Slot²** (`slotsq`): the frontend, this repo's `crates/` and `card/`. A fork of
  [slot](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot) (at `f1f6ef9`) with
  [slotPlusUltra](https://github.com/nelynes/slotPlus) merged in (WonderSwan, Lynx, Game
  Gear, NeoGeo Pocket, TurboGrafx-16, DS) and our changes. Fork changes in the code are
  marked "Slot²", slotPlus's "slotPlus".
- They meet only through [CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md). Neither names the other's internals,
  and Slot² never names the device: it reads `/etc/slot-device`.
- Running slot on ROCKNIX was retired on 2026-11-06; its notes and probe scripts are in
  `history/rocknix/`.

## Branches

- `slotsq-plus`: the current work (local only, not pushed yet). It is
  `claude/beautiful-feynman-ffzfnx` plus the slotPlusUltra merge and everything since.
- `claude/beautiful-feynman-ffzfnx`: on the fork (`SerjTargarien/slot-alt`) up to
  `e9c035d`. Fold `slotsq-plus` into it and push when the user asks.
- No release until Base² and Slot² are stable and feature complete.

## The device

- Dev card in slot 1 runs Base²; the ROCKNIX card in slot 2 is the recovery (swap it into
  slot 1 to boot ROCKNIX and read the dev card).
- SSH: `ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=~/.ssh/known_hosts_basesq root@192.168.1.72`.
- The card's `System/` holds Slot²'s build and slotPlus's nine cores from its release
  `v1.14.0-plus2.6` (`System/premerge/` and `System/slot.premerge` are the pre-merge ones).
- A `basesq-dev` file at the card's root keeps Wi-Fi (and SSH) up in games. Remove it
  for battery runs.

## Working

- Base²: `os/dev.sh` (see [os/README.md](os/README.md)).
- Slot²: `tools/slotsq/dev.sh build | deploy | restart | logs NAME | shot NAME |
  capture NAME VAR=x`. Deploy and restart only once the user is on the shelf: a restart
  ends a game in play.
- Measurements: `SLOT_TRACE_POWER=1` in `/run/slot.env`, then
  `python3 -I tools/slotsq/medians.py NAME` on logs saved with `dev.sh logs NAME`.
- Run commands as `. "$HOME/.cargo/env"` first. Tests: the `render_*`, `server_ui`,
  `pipeline` and `quad` tests need macOS (`HeadlessSurface`); `romm_ui` needs
  `--features romm`. Failing before our work: `slot-ui` `house_label` (one test), and the
  `slot-store` `header_index` tests are flaky.
- Format with `rustfmt --edition 2021` per file, never `cargo fmt --all`: upstream's files
  aren't formatted, so only lines we touch must be.
- Commits: plain messages, author and committer Serj Targarien
  (`xergy10@gmail.com`), no `Co-Authored-By` or session lines.
- Remote commands: background only the restart, as its own statement
  (`...; setsid sh -c "..." < /dev/null > /dev/null 2>&1 &`). A backgrounded
  `a && b &` chain dies with the SSH session.
- Ask before anything costly or hard to undo. Wi-Fi credentials never leave the device.

## Where things stand

Done and checked on the device:
- Base² boots in 11-12 s on our kernel; every button, FN, sound (speaker and headphones),
  brightness on a linear scale, Wi-Fi run by the frontend with power save, network time,
  Gamebit for files.
- Slot² uses the whole 720x720 panel (a height-aware canvas), 10-row menus, a Stretch
  shortcut pair (Menu+L1/R1) and Stretch On/Off per platform.
- slotPlusUltra merged: RetroAchievements off at build time (its row hidden); its H700
  HDMI runs only on BaseOS's fbdev; its update channel hidden (`SELF_UPDATE=0`).
- Scale (Integer or Fit, never "actual") and Stretch for Game Gear, NeoGeo Pocket,
  TurboGrafx-16 (following its width), WonderSwan and Lynx (either orientation, following
  the frame). No bezels at these sizes yet.

## Next, in order

1. **Button mapping** (the user's request): per-system mappings, and several physical
   buttons on one emulated input. Trigger: WonderSwan items in Dicing Knight (the
   WonderSwan has X1-X4 and Y1-Y4). Read `Controls`/`GameButton` (`slot-store`
   `bindings.rs`), the In-Game Controls page, `Pad::mask` and slotPlus's per-core masks
   (`session.rs`), then propose a design before building.
2. **Install the renamed Base²** on the device if not done yet (new kernel suffix
   `-basesq`, `/etc/basesq/`, `/data`, card files `basesq-*`). See "Renaming" below.
3. The DS on the square screen: layouts that use it (stacked screens at about 1.9x).
4. Check a vertical WonderSwan game and Klonoa's mid-game turn.
5. Bezels at Integer and Fit for the new systems.
6. Learn to build the cores ourselves (`cores/*/build.sh`) before adding more.
7. Our own KMS HDMI (the RGB20SX has `HDMI-A-1`); link play when the second device
   arrives; our own U-Boot.

Label art for the new systems (the art server covers only GB, GBC and GBA): WS 324x132,
Lynx 284x190, GG 290x200, NGP 246x133, TG16 191 wide up to 163 tall, NDS 230x250.

## Renaming (2026-11-06)

The OS was called "slot²" (`slotsq`) until 2026-11-06; it is Base² (`basesq`) now and
"Slot²" is the frontend. On a device installed before then: the kernel is
`7.2.11-slotsq` booted as `/Image.slotsq` with `device_trees/slotsq.dtb`, the scripts are
in `/etc/slotsq/`, the hostname is `slotsq` and the card files are `slotsq-boot.log` and
`slotsq-dev`. The new frontend script accepts both kernel suffixes.
